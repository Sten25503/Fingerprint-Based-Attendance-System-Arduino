# Fingerprint-Based-Attendance-System-Arduino
Arduino-based Fingerprint Attendance System with Real-Time Clock (RTC) and EEPROM storage. This project utilizes Adafruit_Fingerprint, LiquidCrystal_I2C, SoftwareSerial, and virtuabotixRTC libraries to implement a biometric attendance solution. Users can enroll, delete, and register attendance through a fingerprint sensor.

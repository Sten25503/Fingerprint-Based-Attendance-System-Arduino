#FingerprintHandler.h 

The FingerprintHandler.h file contains the declaration of the FingerprintHandler class, which encapsulates the functionality for interacting with a fingerprint sensor in an Arduino-based biometric system. This class is responsible for managing fingerprint enrollment, deletion, and verification processes.



##FingerprintHandler.cpp 

The FingerprintHandler.cpp file provides the implementation of the FingerprintHandler class declared in FingerprintHandler.h. This class encapsulates the logic for managing interactions with a fingerprint sensor in an Arduino-based biometric system.



###AttendanceHandler.h 

The AttendanceHandler.h file defines the AttendanceHandler class, which manages the overall functionality of an Arduino-based biometric attendance system. This class orchestrates interactions with a real-time clock (RTC), a fingerprint sensor, and an LCD display to record attendance based on fingerprint verification.



####AttendanceHandler.cpp 

The AttendanceHandler.cpp file contains the implementation of the AttendanceHandler class, declared in AttendanceHandler.h. This class manages the overall operation of an Arduino-based biometric attendance system, coordinating interactions with a real-time clock (RTC), a fingerprint sensor, and an LCD display.
